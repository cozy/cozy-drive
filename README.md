[Cozy] Drive
=====


What's Cozy?
----

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.


What's Drive?
----

Cozy Drive makes your file management easy. Main features are:

- File tree
- Files and folders upload.
- Files and folders sharing (via URLs)
- Files and folders search


Getting Started
----

_:pushpin: Note:_ [Yarn] is the official Node package manager of Cozy. Don't hesitate to [install Yarn][yarn-install] and use it in any Cozy projects.

### Install

Starting the Drive app requires you to [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive.git
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn install
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to set the local node version indicated in the `.nvmrc` before doing a `yarn install`.

:warning: During its early ages, _cozy-drive_ uses beta versions of [cozy-ui] and [cozy-client-js], take a look at the ["living on the edge" note](#living-on-the-edge) below to know how to install and configure the latest available versions.

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks, like watch, lint, test, buildâ€¦

### Run in dev mode

Using a watcher - with Hot Module Replacement:
```sh
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn watch:drive:browser
$ cozy-stack serve --appdir drive:/<project_absolute_path>/cozy-drive/build/drive --disable-csp
```

Or directly build the app (static file generated):
```sh
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn build:drive
$ cozy-stack serve --appdir drive:/<project_absolute_path>/cozy-drive/build/drive
```

Your app is available at http://drive.cozy.localhost:8080/#/folder

Note: it's mandatory to explicit to cozy-stack the folder of the build that should be served, to be able to run the app.

### Run it inside the VM

You can easily view your current running app, you can use the [cozy-stack docker image][cozy-stack-docker]:

```sh
# in a terminal, run your app in watch mode
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn watch:drive:browser
```

```sh
# in another terminal, run the docker container
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)/build/drive":/data/cozy-app/drive cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

Your app is available at http://drive.cozy.tools:8080.

Advanced case
----

### Share and send mails in development

Cozy apps let users [share documents from cozy to cozy](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/sharing.md#cozy-to-cozy-sharing).

Meet Alice and Bob.
Alice wants to share a folder with Bob.
Alice clicks on the share button and fills in the email input with Bob's email address.
Bob receives an email with a _Â« Accept the sharing Â»_ button.
Bob clicks on that button and is redirected to Alice's cozy to enter his own cozy url to link both cozys.
Bob sees Alice's shared folder in his own cozy.

ðŸ¤” But how could we do this scenario on binary cozy-stack development environment?

If you develop with the [cozy-stack CLI](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/cli/cozy-stack.md), you have to run [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) on your computer and tell `cozy-stack serve` where to find the mail server with some [options](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/cli/cozy-stack_serve.md#options):

```
./cozy-stack serve --appdir drive:../cozy-drive/build,settings:../cozy-settings/build --mail-disable-tls --mail-port 1025
```

_This commands assumes you `git clone` [cozy-drive](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive) and [cozy-settings](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-settings) in the same folder than you `git clone` [cozy-stack](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack)._

Then simply run `mailhog` and open http://cozy.tools:8025/.

#### Retrieve sent emails

With MailHog, **every email** sent by cozy-stack is caught. That means the email address *does not have to be a real one*, ie. `bob@cozy`, `bob@cozy.tools` are perfectly fine. It *could be a real one*, but the email will not reach the real recipient's inbox, say `contact@cozycloud.cc`.


### Run on you mobile phone or your tablet :phone:

[See specific documentation](src/drive/targets/mobile/README.md).


### Living on the edge

[Cozy-ui] is our frontend stack library that provides common styles and components accross the whole Cozy's apps. You can use it for you own application to follow the official Cozy's guidelines and styles. If you need to develop / hack cozy-ui, it's sometimes more useful to develop on it through another app. You can do it by cloning cozy-ui locally and link it to yarn local index:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-ui.git
cd cozy-ui
yarn install
yarn link
```

then go back to your app project and replace the distributed cozy-ui module with the linked one:

```sh
cd cozy-drive
yarn link cozy-ui
```

You can now run the watch task and your project will hot-reload each times a cozy-ui source file is touched.

###### Troubleshooting
Consider using [rlink] instead of `yarn link`


[Cozy-client-js] is our API library that provides an unified API on top of the cozy-stack. If you need to develop / hack cozy-client-js in parallel of your application, you can use the same trick that we used with [cozy-ui]: yarn linking.


### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [chai] and [sinon]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.


### Open a Pull-Request

If you want to work on Drive and submit code modifications, feel free to open pull-requests! See the [contributing guide][contribute] for more information about how to properly open pull-requests.


Community

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx].

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled [by the pipeline][yarn tx in travis.yml] when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must configure the [Transifex CLI][tx-cli], and claim access as _maintainer_ to the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push -s` command.

If you were using a [transifex-client](tx-client), you must move to [Transifex CLI](tx-cli) to be compatible with the v3 API.

The transifex configuration file is still in an old version. Please use the previous client for the moment [https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/).

###### Drive specificity

CozyDrive and CozyPhotos share this mono-repository but the translations are split into two projects Transifex.
That is why the translation files are not present in this repository.

To update the translation in other language, make the changes directly on [tx-translate]. Select one language and click on **global**
