Cozy Files allows you to:
    - Access the files you have in your personal cloud
    - Automatically synchronize your phone or tablet's photos with your Cozy

Respectful of the user's privacy, Cozy Cloud simplifies daily tasks: synchronize and backup photos, automate bills downloading, manage expenses, etc. Flexible and easy to use, our Open Source platform allows users to create and develop their own applications.
