# Share and send mail in development

Cozy apps let users [share documents from cozy to cozy](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/sharing.md#cozy-to-cozy-sharing).

Meet Alice and Bob.
Alice wants to share a folder with Bob.
Alice clicks on the share button and fills in the email input with Bob's email address.
Bob receives an email with a _Â« Accept the sharing Â»_ button.
Bob clicks on that button and is redirected to Alice's cozy to enter his own cozy url to link both cozys.
Bob sees Alice's shared folder in his own cozy.

ðŸ¤” But how could we do this scenario on development environment?

## With the docker image

If you develop with the [cozy-app-dev docker image](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/client-app-dev.md#with-docker), [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is running inside it to catch emails.

If cozy-stack has to send an email, MailHog catches it and exposes it on its web interface on http://cozy.tools:8025/.

## With the binary cozy-stack

If you develop with the [cozy-stack CLI](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/cli/cozy-stack.md), you have to run [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) on your computer and tell `cozy-stack serve` where to find the mail server with some [options](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/cli/cozy-stack_serve.md#options):

```
./cozy-stack serve --appdir drive:../cozy-drive/build,settings:../cozy-settings/build --mail-disable-tls --mail-port 1025
```

_This commands assumes you `git clone` [cozy-drive](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive) and [cozy-settings](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-settings) in the same folder than you `git clone` [cozy-stack](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack)._

Then simply run `mailhog` and open http://cozy.tools:8025/.

## Retrieve sent emails

With MailHog, **every email** sent by cozy-stack is caught. That means the email address *does not have to be a real one*, ie. `bob@cozy`, `bob@cozy.tools` are perfectly fine. It *could be a real one*, but the email will not reach the real recipient's inbox, say `contact@cozycloud.cc`.
